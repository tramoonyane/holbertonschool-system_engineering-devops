Readme for www.foobar.com Infrastructure:

Components:
Load Balancer (HAproxy):

Why: Balances incoming traffic among multiple servers, distributing the load.
Specifics: Configured as a cluster for high availability (HA) to ensure uninterrupted service even if one load balancer fails.
Benefits: Enhances fault tolerance and scalability, preventing a single point of failure.
Web Server (x1):

Why: Serves static content, handling client requests.
Specifics: Isolated from the application server to separate concerns and enhance security.
Benefits: Improved performance, simplified maintenance, and better security posture.
Application Server (x1):

Why: Executes application logic, handling dynamic content.
Specifics: Separated from the web server for modularity and scalability.
Benefits: Allows independent scaling, fault isolation, and easier maintenance.
Database Server (x1):

Why: Stores and manages application data.
Specifics: Maintained independently to isolate data storage from application logic.
Benefits: Easier maintenance, better security, and scalability by potentially separating read and write operations.
Explanations:
Load Balancer (HAproxy):

Why: Ensures high availability and distributes traffic evenly across servers.
Benefits: Prevents overload on a single server, improves fault tolerance, and facilitates scaling.
Web Server (x1):

Why: Separates static content handling from dynamic content processing.
Benefits: Optimizes resource utilization, simplifies maintenance, and enhances security by isolating the web layer.
Application Server (x1):

Why: Isolates application logic from the web layer.
Benefits: Enables independent scaling, modular development, and better resource allocation.
Database Server (x1):

Why: Separates data storage from application logic.
Benefits: Facilitates data management, enhances security by isolating the data layer, and allows for optimized scaling.
Additional Considerations:
Scalability: The modular structure allows for independent scaling of web servers, application servers, and database servers based on demand.

Security: Isolating components enhances security by minimizing the attack surface and isolating potential breaches.

Maintenance: Separate servers for different components simplify maintenance and updates, minimizing downtime and reducing the risk of unexpected issues.

This infrastructure design prioritizes modularity, scalability, and fault tolerance while ensuring that each component's responsibilities are clearly defined and separated for optimal performance and security.
